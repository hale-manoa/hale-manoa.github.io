# About Hale Manoa
[Hale Manoa]() is a tool for University of Hawaii at Manoa students to browse available and affordable housing options in the area. With Hale Manoa, users are able to directly compare prices and find housing adequate for their needs. Furthermore, local individuals and businesses are able to advertise their housing options while gaining community recognition through reviews given by other users.

This milestone started on April 3, 2018 and ended on April 12, 2018

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages to provide a mockup for the pages that will be in our application. This mockup was developed as a Meteor app. 

Mockups for the following pages were implemented during M1:
